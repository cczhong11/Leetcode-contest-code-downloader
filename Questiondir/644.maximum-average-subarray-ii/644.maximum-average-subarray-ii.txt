Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to k that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.



Example 1:

Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation:
when length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,
when length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.
Thus return 12.75.




Note:

1 k n 
Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000].
The answer with the calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.
